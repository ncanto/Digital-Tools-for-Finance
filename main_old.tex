\section{Context and motivation}


The goal of this paper is to analyze the correlation between the 10 Year Treasury Yield and cryptocurrencies. The 10 Year Treasury Rate is the yield one receives for investing in US government securities with a maturity of 10 years. It is a common proxy for the risk free rate. Therefore, this paper will shed light on the influence of the risk free rate on the price of cryptocurrencies. \\

We considered 4 different cryptocurrencies, namely Bitcoin, Etherium,  XRP (Ripple) and Litecoin. As of November 2022, all four were within the 15 cryptocurrencies with the highes market capitalization (see for example Quelle 2). Furthermore we consider a cryptocurrency index called  CMC Crypto 200 Index by Solactive. The CMC Crypto 200 Index tracks the price movementes of the top 200 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. It was launched at year end 2018 and is calculated and distributed by Solactive AG. The index is published in USD. Calculation of the index price is conducted on a daily basis. (Quelle 1)
